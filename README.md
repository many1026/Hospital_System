Generating Medical Reports
## Problem: Generating Medical Reports in PDF and Excel

### Description

A Python program is required to generate medical reports in both PDF and Excel formats based on user-provided data stored in existing data files. The program should allow the user to input relevant information, such as the doctor's name, specialty, medications, email, treatment, laboratory, composition, as well as select a patient and diagnosis, and generate vital sign data for each day of a week. The medical reports must include all of this data organized in tables within the PDF and Excel documents, with appropriate titles and presentation style.

The program can be divided into several phases:

1. **User Data Input**: The user is prompted to enter personal and medical information, including the doctor's name, specialty, medications, email, treatment, laboratory, and composition.

2. **Patient and Diagnosis Selection**: The user selects a patient and a diagnosis from a pre-existing list.

3. **Vital Sign Data Generation**: Random vital sign data is generated for each day of the week.

4. **Medical Report Creation**: The collected data is organized into medical reports in PDF and Excel formats. The content is divided into three sections, with suitable titles and customized presentation styles. Patient information, file numbers, and diagnoses are included at the bottom of the report.

5. **Report Saving**: The generated reports are saved in PDF and Excel files for future use.

This program addresses the need for accurate and comprehensive medical reports generated from user-provided data, improving the organization and presentation of medical information.
